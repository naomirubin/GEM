  GEM Applet
</h1>

## Tech Stack

We use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), an awesome static-site generator that leverages on [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create our app. All our content is driven by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and sourced through [Contentful](https://contentful.com/). 

## Installation instructions


Enter the GEM folder using `cd GEM` (maybe also `cd gem-app` I'm not entirely sure) and follow the Node, React, and [Gatsby global installation tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) and make sure you have everyting installed properly.

Install all npm packages in the root directory of the folder using `npm install`
